# Solo Sealed Action Turn — Sequence

One complete action turn in **solo play**. The submit-and-wait barrier stage
is architecturally present on every turn but collapses to a no-op when only
one player is in the session. See [`multiplayer-sealed-turns.md`](./multiplayer-sealed-turns.md)
for the full multiplayer variant. (The "sealed-letter" name is historical — the
barrier waits, but action text is peer-visible during the wait per ADR-036
amendment 2026-05-03; hidden-submission "sealed visibility" is reserved for PvP
and not implemented.)

## Solo vs. multiplayer submit-and-wait

Three things collapse to no-ops when only one player is in the session:

1. **No barrier wait.** `SessionRoom.TurnBarrier` never installs for a single player.
2. **No `TurnStatus("submitted")` broadcast.** The submission acknowledgement
   is gated on barrier existence.
3. **No `ActionReveal`.** The peer reveal message is part of the barrier
   resolution path only — see ADR-036 for the visibility doctrine.

So in solo, a turn is:

```
PLAYER_ACTION → THINKING → narrator → NARRATION → NARRATION_END
              → PARTY_STATUS (+ CHAPTER_MARKER / IMAGE / ITEM_DEPLETED)
              → typed state-change messages
```

(`MAP_UPDATE` was retired with the live world-map view 2026-04-28; see ADR-019 supersession + ADR-055 room-graph navigation. The cartography YAML now seeds `snap.current_region` at chargen only.)

The seal / wait / reveal ceremony only exists to keep multiplayer players
in sync and to preserve simultaneous-resolution fairness.

## Message fan-out paths

Two different fan-out paths feed the same writer task (asyncio.Queue per connection plus a shared session broadcast):

- **Per-connection queue** — targeted at one player. Used for `NARRATION`,
  `NARRATION_END`, and any response tied to the acting player. See
  `server/websocket_session_handler.py` for the reader/writer split.
- **Session broadcast** (`SessionRoom.broadcast(...)` in `server/session_room.py`) —
  scoped to players in the same genre:world session, with optional
  per-player targeting via projection-filter (`game/projection/`). Used for
  multiplayer session events including `ActionReveal` and typed state-change
  broadcasts.
- **Global watcher fan-out** (`/ws/watcher` via `server/watcher.py` + `telemetry/watcher_hub.py`) —
  separate from gameplay traffic; streams telemetry to GM Mode.

All three feed the same `ws.send_text(...)` at the bottom of the writer
`asyncio.gather(...)` loop.
