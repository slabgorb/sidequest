# ADR-060: Genre Models Decomposition — Split models.rs by Domain

> **Status amendment (2026-04-23):** The decomposition was executed as part of
> the Rust→Python port (ADR-082). Current home: `sidequest-server/sidequest/genre/models/`
> with domain submodules matching the plan below. See the Post-port mapping
> section at the end of this ADR.

## Context

`sidequest-genre/src/models.rs` has grown to 2,651 lines containing 102 struct/enum
definitions and 18 impl blocks. Every genre pack feature that adds a new model type
appends to this single file. The file now spans at least 10 distinct domains:

- **Character creation** — `CharCreationScene`, `CharCreationChoice`, `MechanicalEffects`
- **OCEAN personality** — `OceanProfile`, `OceanDimension`, `OceanShift`, `OceanShiftLog`
- **Narrative/drama** — `DramaThresholds`, `GenreTheme`, `Dinkus`, `SessionOpener`, `Prompts`, `OpeningHook`
- **Lore** — `Lore`, `WorldLore`, `Faction`, `NpcArchetype`
- **Progression** — `PassiveProgression`, `ProgressionConfig`, `Affinity`, `AffinityTier`, `PowerTier`
- **Confrontation/combat** — `ConfrontationDef`, `BeatDef`, `MetricDef`, `SecondaryStatDef`
- **Audio** — `AudioConfig`, `AudioAiGeneration`, `MoodTrack`, `AudioTheme`, `AudioVariation`
- **World/cartography** — `WorldConfig`, `WorldGraph`, `WorldGraphNode`, `CartographyConfig`, `Region`, `Route`
- **Scenario** — `ScenarioPack`, `PlayerRole`, `ClueGraph`, `AssignmentMatrix`, `Suspect`
- **Inventory/economy** — `InventoryConfig`, `CurrencyConfig`, `CatalogItem`, `WealthTier`
- **Voice/culture** — `Culture`, `CultureSlot`, `CorpusRef`, `VoicePresets`, `VoiceConfig`, `CreatureVoicePreset`

This makes the file a merge-conflict magnet and violates Rust's locality principle —
types are separated from related behavior, and unrelated types share a namespace.

## Decision

**Split `models.rs` into a `models/` directory with domain-grouped submodules.**

```

### Migration Strategy

1. `mod.rs` re-exports everything via `pub use submodule::*` — downstream crates see
   no API change. Zero-breakage migration.
2. Move types one domain at a time, running `cargo check` after each move.
3. Move `impl` blocks with their types — keep behavior next to data.
4. Raw/validated pairs (e.g., `RawBeatDef` + `BeatDef` + `TryFrom`) stay together.

## Alternatives Considered

### Keep single file, add section comments
Already the status quo (the file has section separators). Doesn't solve merge conflicts
or the 2,651-line cognitive load. Rejected.

### Split into separate crates
Over-engineering. These types all serve genre pack deserialization and share serde
derives. Crate boundaries would add inter-crate dependency overhead with no visibility
benefit. Rejected.

## Consequences

- **Positive:** Each domain module is 150-300 lines. Merge conflicts between unrelated
  features drop to near zero. Types live next to their impl blocks.
- **Positive:** New genre features have a clear home — add a trope type? `narrative.rs`.
  Add a room variant? `world.rs`.
- **Negative:** One-time migration churn. Mitigated by the re-export strategy.
- **Risk:** Over-splitting. If a domain module ends up under 50 lines, fold it back into
  its nearest neighbor.

## Post-port mapping (ADR-082)

The decomposition decision carried forward to Python intact. Rust layout →
Python layout:

- `sidequest-genre/src/models.rs` (monolithic) → `sidequest-server/sidequest/genre/models/` (package directory)
- Submodules preserved by domain: `pack.py`, `world.py`, `character.py`, `narrative.py`, `lore.py`, `progression.py`, `confrontation.py`, `audio.py`, `scenario.py`, `inventory.py`, `voice.py`
- Re-export strategy translates to `__init__.py` — public imports remain `from sidequest.genre.models import GenrePack, OceanProfile, …`
- Rust's "impl blocks colocate with types" constraint does not apply in Python; methods live on the class in the same file as the class definition.
